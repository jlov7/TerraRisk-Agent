# Offline Fixtures

Synthetic FEMA NRI extracts and generated artifacts used for the offline demo mode.
- `offline_nri.csv` – slice emulating FEMA NRI metrics across hurricane, flood, and wildfire hazards.
- `artifacts/` – runtime folder where placeholder PDFs/GeoJSON/CSVs are written during offline runs.
- Set `ARTIFACT_DIR` to redirect artifact output for tests or alternate storage targets.
